# Quick Responses Guide

The Quick Responses feature allows administrators to create pre-approved text templates that team members can quickly copy to their clipboard with a single click.

## For Administrators

### Setting Up Quick Responses

1. **Access Admin Settings:**
   - Open the extension settings page
   - Scroll to "Quick Responses (Admin)" section

2. **Set Admin Password (Recommended):**
   - Enter a password in the "Admin Password" field
   - Click "Set/Update Password"
   - This protects admin settings from unauthorized changes

3. **Unlock Admin Section:**
   - Enter your admin password
   - Click "Unlock Admin Settings"
   - The admin panel will now be accessible

4. **Add Responses:**
   - Click "+ Add Response"
   - Fill in the form:
     - **Title**: Short, descriptive name (e.g., "Thank You Email")
     - **Category**: Optional grouping (e.g., "Customer Service", "Sales", "Support")
     - **Text**: The actual text that will be copied
   - Click "Add Response"

5. **Manage Responses:**
   - **Edit**: Click "Edit" on any response to modify it
   - **Delete**: Click "Delete" to remove a response
   - Changes are saved automatically

### Best Practices

- **Use Clear Titles**: Make it easy for users to find what they need
- **Organize with Categories**: Group related responses together
- **Keep Text Concise**: Long responses work, but shorter ones are easier to scan
- **Regular Updates**: Review and update responses periodically
- **Test Before Deploying**: Make sure responses are formatted correctly

### Example Responses
