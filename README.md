### Firefox

**Important:** Firefox looks for `manifest.json` in the root directory. You need to temporarily swap the manifest files before loading.

#### Quick Method (Using Helper Scripts)

1. **Switch to Firefox manifest:**
   ```bash
   ./switch-to-firefox.sh
   ```

2. **Load the extension:**
   - Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`
   - Click "This Firefox" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Select the `manifest.json` file (it's now the Firefox version)
   - The extension will now replace your new tab page

3. **After testing, restore Chrome manifest:**
   ```bash
   ./switch-to-chrome.sh
   ```

#### Manual Method

1. **Backup and swap manifests:**
   ```bash
   cp manifest.json manifest.chrome.json
   cp manifest.firefox.json manifest.json
   ```

2. **Load the extension:**
   - Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`
   - Click "This Firefox" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Select the `manifest.json` file

3. **Restore Chrome manifest when done:**
   ```bash
   cp manifest.chrome.json manifest.json
   ```

**Note:** Temporary add-ons are removed when Firefox restarts. For permanent installation, package the extension as a `.xpi` file or submit to Firefox Add-ons (AMO).

## Creating Icons

You'll need to create icon files for the extension:

- `icons/icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icons/icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icons/icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

### Methods to Create Icons

- Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.)
- Use online icon generators (e.g., favicon-generator.org)
- Create simple colored squares with your brand colors
- The icons should represent your brand or the dashboard concept

## Customization for Administrators

### Brand Color Setup

1. Identify your brand's primary, secondary, and accent colors
2. Convert them to hex format (e.g., #4A90E2)
3. Enter them in the settings page
4. All dashboard elements will update to match your brand

### Team Deployment

For deploying to a team:

1. Configure the extension with your brand colors
2. Set up default links that your team uses
3. Export the settings (you may need to manually document them)
4. Share the configured extension or settings with your team

**Note:** Browser extensions store data locally. For team-wide deployment, consider:
- Creating a setup guide with recommended settings
- Using group policy (for enterprise Chrome)
- Creating a packaged extension with default settings

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Manifest V3 (Chrome 88+)
- **Firefox**: Manifest V2 (Firefox 109+)

## Privacy

- All data is stored locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers

## Troubleshooting

### Settings not saving
- Check browser permissions
- Try refreshing the settings page
- Clear browser cache if issues persist

### Colors not updating
- Save settings and refresh the new tab page
- Check that color values are in correct format (hex for colors, rgba for backgrounds)

## Development

### Making Changes

1. Edit the relevant files
2. **For Chrome:** Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the refresh icon on your extension
3. **For Firefox:** 
   - Make sure you've switched to Firefox manifest (`./switch-to-firefox.sh`)
   - Reload the extension in `about:debugging`
   - After testing, restore Chrome manifest (`./switch-to-chrome.sh`)

### Testing

- Test color changes in the settings page
- Verify all features work in both Chrome and Firefox
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- **Remember:** When testing in Firefox, use the helper scripts to switch manifests, or manually swap `manifest.json` with `manifest.firefox.json`
